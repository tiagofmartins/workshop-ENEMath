# Evolving harmonographs

This tutorial covers the application of a Genetic Algorithm on a generative design process. The goal is to evolve computer-generated drawings. In particular, we will be evolving [harmonographs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonograph). To be precise, we will evolve a set of parameters that control the algorithmic drawing of harmonographs.
